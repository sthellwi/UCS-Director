## UCS Director Exchange 2012 Rollout

UCS Director by itself offers many ways to integrate different solutions. For example, there is always the option to create granular individual Workflows by integrating existing scripts. In addition, you could also use "Open Automation" or "Script Modules".


### Prerequisites

Before we begin to create the workflow, we need to have a working Windows 2012 image and a running PowerShell Agent which is integrated into UCS Director.
